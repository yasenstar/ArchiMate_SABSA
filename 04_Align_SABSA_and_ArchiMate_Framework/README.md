# 04 Alignment the SABSA and ArchiMate Frameworks

# 04.1 Introduction to the Security Overlay

The Security Overlay for the ArchiMate language focuses on extending the architectural layers and Motivation aspect to create a model-based framework for SABSA.

The Security Overlay for the ArchiMate langugae uses the inbuilt customization capabilities of the ArchiMate Specification to define a Security Overlay: a set of security profiles for existing ArchiMate elements, supplemented by a set of new stereotyped elements, to express security concepts.

Link https://sabsa.org/category/working-groups/modelling-sabsa-archimate/ is to the MSA Working Group (Modeling SABSA ArchiMate), it has one whitepaper but still in ArchiMate v2.01, you need to register as SABSA member to be allowed for downloading the resources. (Whitepaper is downloaded and can be read [here](./T100-Modelling-SABSA-with-ArchiMate_v2.01.pdf))

From SABSA perspective, back to upper link https://sabsa.org/category/working-groups/, you may find four Working Group which ArchiMate is one of them, I'm putting them briefly as below and would be take time to explore others once we've done this ArchiMate one first:
